# 🚀 Pikabook Development Branch
This is the main development branch where reviewed and approved code is integrated.


## 📋 Branch Usage

- Purpose: Integration of reviewed features and bug fixes
- Status: Development in progress
- Merge to: main (after thorough testing)


## 🌿 Feature Development

When working on new features:
``` 
1. Create a new branch: dev/feature/your-feature-name
2. Develop your feature
3. Create a Pull Request to merge back into dev
4. Wait for code review and approval
```


**Branch Naming Convention**
- dev/feature/user_authentication
- dev/feature/payment_system  
- dev/feature/dashboard_ui



## ⚠️ Important Rules

- Never push directly to this branch
- All changes must go through Pull Requests
- Code must be reviewed before merging
- Test your feature before creating PR
- Keep commits clean and follow commit convention



## 🔄 Workflow

- `dev/feature/your-feature` → PR → dev
- dev → PR → main (for releases)
